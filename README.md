- Select the new layout from System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources (It will appear in the "Other section")

# About

After an entire month of trying to get used to Apple's shitty idea of a "Hungarian" keyboard layout,
I decided that it was time to go back to the superior, traditional layout. 
I tried out zaki's (https://github.com/zaki/mac-hun-keyboard) layout, but it still felt a little off, 
so with Ukulele, I tweaked it to be completely true to the original Hungarian keyboard layout 
(yes, even special characters like ¤ are in place).

You can do whatever, just don't blame me if something doesn't work out.
